<!-- - The genome (chromosome) is split into equally sized regions -->
<!-- - Data is represented by a symmetric matrix of contacts $C_{ij}$ where entry $ij$ corresponds to the number of times region $i$ comes into contact with region $j$ -->
<!-- - Off-diagonal data view - increasing **distance** between interacting regions -->
<!-- - Power-law decay of interactions with increasing **distance** -->
